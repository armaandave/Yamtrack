# Music Phase 9: Backend API Freeze

Status: **frozen for iOS implementation**

API version: **v1**

Contract snapshot: **2026-07-16**

These are the Django contracts iOS may implement against. Changing a documented
field name, JSON type, nullability rule, pagination envelope, or success status
requires an intentional v1 contract review with the Swift client.

## Response examples

The examples are rendered DRF responses from a deterministic end-to-end API
test, not hand-written schema approximations:

- [Phase 9 API response bundle](contracts/phase-9-api-responses.example.json)
- [Full album detail](contracts/album-detail.example.json)
- [Track](contracts/track.example.json)
- [Full recording detail](contracts/song-detail.example.json)

The Phase 9 bundle keys name the response family they freeze. Endpoints that
return the same serializer shape deliberately reuse a key.

The enforcing test is
[`src/api/tests/test_music_phase9_contract.py`](../../src/api/tests/test_music_phase9_contract.py).
Update the Django fixture and Swift decoding together; a fixture-only update is
not an acceptable contract change.

## Frozen endpoints

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metadata | `GET /api/v1/meta/` | `200` | `meta` |
| Music search | `GET /api/v1/media/search/?media_type=music&q={query}&page={page}` | `200` | `music_search` |

| Tracking update | `PUT` or `PATCH` on the tracking detail URL | `200` | `tracking_update` |
| Tracking action | `POST /api/v1/tracking/{source}/{media_type}/{media_id}/actions/{action}/` | `200` | `tracking_action` |
| Diary create | `POST /api/v1/diary/` | `201` | `diary_create` |
| Diary detail | `GET /api/v1/diary/{entry_id}/` | `200` | `diary_detail` |
| Diary list | `GET /api/v1/diary/` | `200` | `diary_list` |
| Lists | `GET /api/v1/lists/` | `200` | `lists` |
| List create | `POST /api/v1/lists/` | `201` | `list_create` |
| List detail | `GET /api/v1/lists/{list_id}/` | `200` | `list_detail` |
| Add list item | `POST /api/v1/lists/{list_id}/items/` | `201` | `list_item_add` |
| Current/public profile | `GET /api/v1/me/` or `GET /api/v1/users/{username}/` | `200` | `profile` |
| Preferences | `PATCH /api/v1/me/preferences/` | `200` | `preferences` |
| Hall of Fame | `GET /api/v1/me/hof/`, `PUT` or `DELETE /api/v1/me/hof/{media_type}/` | `200` | `hall_of_fame` |
| Activity | `GET /api/v1/users/{username}/activity/` | `200` | `activity` |
| Statistics | `GET /api/v1/stats/me/summary/` or `GET /api/v1/users/{username}/stats/summary/` | `200` | `statistics` |
| Filter options | `GET /api/v1/filter-options/?scope={tracking,diary,list}` | `200` | `filter_options` |

Music search requires authentication. Album and recording detail allow anonymous
reads. Tracking, diary writes, lists, preferences, and current-user data require
authentication. When `MUSIC_ENABLED=False`, music is omitted from metadata and
direct music search, detail, recording, tracking, diary, list-item, and Hall of
Fame access is rejected with `404`.

Malformed query parameters or request bodies return DRF field errors with `400`.
Protected routes return `401` without valid authentication. Missing resources
return `404`; music exposure also intentionally uses `404` so a disabled media
type is not discoverable.

Music search accepts `q` (required), `page` (one-based, default `1`), and
`media_type=music`. Its body is empty and its provider pagination fields are
`page`, `total_pages`, `total_results`, and `results`.

### Representative release and tracklist

There is no separate representative-release endpoint. Album detail returns it at
`music.representative_release`; the complete ordered tracklist is
`music.representative_release.media[].tracks[]`. A missing usable release is the
explicit degraded state `representative_release: null`. Track and Recording MBIDs
remain distinct, and recording detail returns `404` unless the Recording MBID is
present on the representative release in the requested album context.

### Tracking requests

`PUT` and `PATCH` accept `status`, `rating`, `progress`, `start_date`, `end_date`,
`notes`, and `season_number`; music ignores numeric progress and always returns
the binary album progress object. The music action used by iOS is `consume`, with
an optional ISO-8601 `consumed_at`. Ratings are decimal strings in responses.

### Diary requests

Create requires `ref`; supported fields are `consumed_at`, `rating`, `review`,
`review_title`, `liked`, `is_rewatch`, `auto_mark_consumed`, `contains_spoilers`,
`visibility`, and `tags`. Detail and create share the same response shape. List
uses the standard `{count,next,previous,results}` page envelope.

### List requests

iOS may also use the following existing operations:

- `GET /lists/?ref[source]=...&ref[media_type]=...&ref[media_id]=...` returns the
  `lists` envelope with `has_item` on each result.
- `PATCH /lists/{id}/` and `PATCH /lists/{id}/items/reorder/` return the
  `list_detail` family.
- `GET /lists/{id}/items/` returns the standard page envelope of media summaries.
- `DELETE /lists/{id}/` and `DELETE /lists/{id}/items/{item_id}/` return `204`
  with no body.
- `GET /lists/{id}/?include_items=false` returns list detail without the `items`
  member.

### Profile, preferences, and Hall of Fame

`GET /me/` and public profile reads have no body. Preferences accepts a partial
object containing keys exposed by the `preferences` example; omitted keys are
unchanged. Hall of Fame `PUT` accepts `{ "ref": { "source", "media_type",
"media_id" } }`; `DELETE` has no body. `GET /me/hof/` returns the same
media-summary family grouped by enabled media type.

### Activity, statistics, and filters

Activity uses cursor pagination (`cursor` query parameter). Statistics accepts
the optional `range`, `start_date`, and `end_date` query parameters documented
by its response. Filter options requires `scope`; iOS passes `media_type=music`
for tracking and diary filters. These endpoints have no request body.

### JSON conventions

- Keys use `snake_case`; MBIDs are lowercase UUID strings.
- Dates use ISO 8601. MusicBrainz metadata may preserve `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, or
  `YYYY-MM-DD`; API-created timestamps include an offset.
- Nullable values are JSON `null`, never an empty object or fabricated value.
- Collection ordering is part of the contract: tracklists are disc/position
  ordered, diary and activity are reverse chronological, and ranked lists expose
  integer positions.
- Standard pages use `{count,next,previous,results}`. Activity uses
  `{next_cursor,previous_cursor,results}`.
- The example IDs are deterministic fixture IDs; clients must treat all database
  IDs as opaque installation-specific integers.

## Validation record

The deterministic contract flow covers metadata, provider-backed music search,
album and recording detail, tracking, diary, lists, Hall of Fame, profile,
preferences, activity, statistics, and filter options. It uses the Year Zero
release group `3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e`, representative release
`2d0bad69-f735-484b-bc0b-2ea54c76225e`, and recording
`35518724-a25a-4627-a2cc-0786dd1d2272`.

Validated on **2026-07-16**:

- Phase 9 targeted/provider/model/music/API/profile/stats/event suites: **144
  passed**, one opt-in provider test skipped.
- Complete `api.tests`: **194 passed**.
- Broad `app users integrations lists events social` suite: **793 passed**, 32
  skips. The import pagination assertion and four anime webhook tests were made
  deterministic before the successful rerun.
- `makemigrations --check --dry-run --settings=config.test_settings`: no changes.
- `ruff check src`: passed.

Live validation used `MUSIC_ENABLED=True`, a fresh migrated temporary SQLite
database, a disposable user transaction, and an isolated Redis 8 container. All
17 search/detail/recording/tracking/consume/diary/list/Hall of
Fame/activity/statistics requests returned `200` or `201`. The album exposed
Cover Art Archive artwork, representative release
`2d0bad69-f735-484b-bc0b-2ea54c76225e`, an ordered 16-track list, and recording
`35518724-a25a-4627-a2cc-0786dd1d2272`.

The cold flow made six upstream calls. Repeating search, album detail, and
recording detail made **zero** additional upstream calls. Redis contained the
versioned MusicBrainz search/release-group/release/recording/representative
release keys, the Cover Art Archive key, API search/detail keys, DRF throttle
keys, and the shared `phase9live_musicbrainz_api` limiter bucket. Actual
MusicBrainz dispatch intervals were `2.128`, `1.593`, `1.056`, `1.054`, and
`1.048` seconds, satisfying the one-request-per-second ceiling. The temporary
database transaction was rolled back and the Redis container removed after the
check.

## Deployment handoff

Deployment is performed from the other computer after `search-page-ios` is
pushed:

1. Confirm the production environment contains `MUSIC_ENABLED=False` without
   printing other environment values.
2. Deploy the pushed `search-page-ios` commit with the existing backend workflow.
3. Confirm migrations complete and clear Django cache.
4. Verify `/api/v1/health/` succeeds.
5. Verify `/api/v1/meta/` omits `music` and `musicbrainz`.
6. Verify direct music search, album, recording, and tracking routes return `404`
   for normal clients.

Do not enable public music exposure until the separate MetaBrainz account and
licensing decision is complete.
